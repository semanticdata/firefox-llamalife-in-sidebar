# Llama Life in Sidebar
## Notice: this addon is ***NOT*** currently published at addons.mozilla.org
A Firefox WebExtension to display [Llama Life](https://llamalife.co/) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Llama Life web app.

Press `Alt+Shift+5` to toggle the sidebar. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Llama Life in Sidebar -> Options.

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Llama Life on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their website in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Llama Life in any way. I respect Marie too much to even consider this. I love Llama Life!
