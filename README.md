A Firefox extension to display Llama Life within the Firefox sidebar. This extension adds a new section to the sidebar which contains the Llama Life web app. It also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

[![Get the Addon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semanticdata/text-revealer-firefox-extension/master/firefox.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/llama-life-in-sidebar/)

## Usage

1. Toggle the sidebar by pressing Alt+Shift+5. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Llama Life in Sidebar -> Options.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

## How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar Width

The sidebar's width is *locked by default* in Firefox. Unfortunately, the sidebar is very restrictive and I can only do so much to enhance the functionality of this extension. I put together a step-by-step guide on how to unlock it over at [my website](https://forgetful.dev/guides/unlock-firefox-sidebar/).

## ⚠ Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Llama Life on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Llama Life in any way.
